# streamdeck-gasprice
Stream Deck plugin to display the current Ethereum gas price

Forked from [original repo here](https://github.com/LilyRose2798/streamdeck-gasprice). Difference is that this plugin will only show the average gas price, whereas the other one shows slow/average/fast price, for easier reading.
